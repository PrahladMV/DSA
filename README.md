## Repository Description
This repository is a collection of various programs and projects related to Data Structures and Algorithms. These programs are implemented in C and C++ and cover a wide range of fundamental concepts and advanced techniques in DSA.

## Features
- Implementation of various data structures (e.g., arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs).
- Algorithms for searching, sorting, and traversal.
- Advanced topics such as dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, and graph algorithms.
- Optimized code with detailed comments and explanations.

## Prerequisites
To run these programs, you need to have a C/C++ compiler installed.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
2. Navigate to the directory
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dsa-programs.git
   ```
## Usage
- Compile and run the programs using a C/C++ compiler. For example:
   ```bash
   g++ program_name.cpp -o program_name
   ./program_name
   ```
## File Descriptions
- `memory_game.py`: The main Python script that runs the game.
- `arrays/`: Directory containing programs related to array data structures.
- `linked_lists/`: Directory containing programs related to linked list data structures.
- `stacks_queues/`: Directory containing programs related to stack and queue data structures.
- `trees/`: Directory containing programs related to tree data structures.
- `graphs/`: Directory containing programs related to graph data structures.
- `sorting_searching/`: Directory containing sorting and searching algorithm implementations.
